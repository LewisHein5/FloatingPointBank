<h3>Make infinite money</h3>

Last time, we lost money by transferring a tiny amount out of our savings account which was rounded up by a factor of almost 2.
If, instead,  we transfer a slightly smaller amount, it will be rounded to zero and we can unlock a cool wealth-building hack that Big Math doesn't want you to know:

<TwoAccountsFloatingPoint @ref="_accounts" OnClick="DisplayExplanation" GetTransferAmount="() => _accounts.GrowingTransferAmount()"/>

<br/>
<br/>

@if (!CollapseExplanation)
{
    <div><h3>What happened?</h3> 
        <p>
            This time, we did the opposite. When we subtract @_accounts.GrowingTransferAmount()
            from @_accounts.OriginalSavingsBalance, this is rounded to the nearest floating-point value, which is still
            @_accounts.OriginalSavingsBalance. This is then added to the smaller balance and rounded to @_accounts.GrowingTransferAmount()
        </p>
